You were not in the right space. You played as if you had something to prove. That caused you to rush. You were so anxious to play the next group of notes that you neglected to play the rests. You didn't give the notes their full life, their full amount of air. In simple terms you played the notes but not the rests. If you don't play the rests, give them as much attention as the notes, you will rush, simple as that."},

We know how to use notes to produce desired results but we are never taught how to use rests that way. If we pay attention to rests and learn how to really use them , we find that they can speak louder and deeper than notes."},
